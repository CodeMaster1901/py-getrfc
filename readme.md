# py-getrfc (A Python script to fetch RFCs)

Thank you for taking the time to check out my first open-source
project!

This script uses the `requests` module to get RFCs from the
IETF website.

On running the application, currently, it will output
all the RFC data on the terminal. Writing to files works
too - but I would love some help in setting up ArgParse.
