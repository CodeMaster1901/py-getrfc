# py-getrfc (A Python script to fetch RFCs)

Thank you for taking the time to check out my first open-source
project!

# WORKING:
```
+ This script uses the `requests` module to get RFCs from the
  IETF website.
+ On running the application, currently, it will input the rfc number and display all the pages regarding the same in the terminal.
```

# USAGE:
```
+ main.py [-h] [-notall] [-tofile] [-name NAME] RFCno

+ Get RFC data from command line (input)
```

# POSITIONAL ARGUEMENTS:
```
+ These are the arguements that dont have a default value. The program cannot be further executed if this arguement is not entered by the user.
+ In this case, the positional arguement is the rfc number whose information you want to display.

  RFCno       RFC Number that you want to get
```

# OPTIONAL ARGUEMENTS:
```
+ These are the arguements the user does not necessarily have to enter. 
+ The program will continue running normally, even when these arguements are not inputed. 

  -h, --help  show this help message and exit
  -notall     specify if you want only first page
  -tofile     Specify if you want to write to a file or just display in shell
              (default - false)
  -name NAME  Name of a file you want to write to
```
  
  
# HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:
 
```
+ The first step to leave the directory you are currently working in like this:
 
  C:\Hacknight_getfrc\py-getrfc-master (1)\py-getrfc-master>cd..\..
  C:\Hacknight_getfrc>cd..

+ The next step is to enter the appropriate directory as depicted:
 
  C:\>cd "\Hacknight_getfrc\py-getrfc-master (1)\py-getrfc-master"\
  C:\Hacknight_getfrc\py-getrfc-master (1)\py-getrfc-master>

+ Next, we need to run the program in command prompt while also giving in the necessary input.
+ In this case, the input is the rfc number. Since this is a positional arguement, the program will throw an error if this arguement is not entered.
  
  C:\Hacknight_getfrc\py-getrfc-master (1)\py-getrfc-master>python main.py 2306

+ Here, 2306 is the rfc number
```

# EXAMPLE:
```
+ If the above steps are followed and the code is run, the output will be as follows:

## About the Application
This script uses the `requests` module to get RFCs from the
IETF website.
On running the application, currently, it will either:
- Output all the RFC data on the terminal
- Write it to a file specified by the user.
## What is IETF?
The Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) is an open standards organization, which develops and promotes voluntary Internet standards, in particular the technical standards that comprise the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP).
## What is RFC?
A Request for Comments (RFC) is an individually numbered publication in a series, from one of a small group of bodies, most prominently the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), the principal technical development and standards-setting bodies for the Internet.

 The RFC system was invented by Steve Crocker in 1969 to help record unofficial notes on the development of ARPANET. RFCs have since become official documents of Internet specifications, communications protocols, procedures, and events.[3] According to Crocker, the documents "shape the Internet's inner workings and have played a significant role in its success".

# Installation

- Clone the repo
- Make sure that the libraries mentioned in requirements.txt have been installed.(If not Please install using pip)
- Go to the terminal (Make sure you are in the application's folder)
- Enter ```python main.py -h ```
- You will get an output of the parameters required and their respective description

# Usage Instructions

This is the syntax of the instruction that must be entered in the terminal(Arguments enclose in [] brackets are optional):
```sh
python main.py [-h] [-notall] [-tofile] [-name NAME] RFCno
```
| Arguments | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| -h | Shows a help message |
| -notall | Specify if you want only first page |
| -tofile | Specify if you want to write to a file or just display in shell(Default is false i.e. Display in shell) |
| -name NAME | Name of a file you want to write to |
| RFCno | RFC Number that you want to get |

# Example

To get the first page of RFC No.15 the command is:
```python main.py -notall 15 ```

Output:
```

call function - first page data to terminal

                Network Subsystem for Time Sharing Hosts


Introduction

   A set of network primitives has been defined (Network Working Group
   Note 11) for inclusion in the monitor systems of the respective
   HOSTS.  These primitives are at the level of system calls: SPOP's or
   BRS's on the 940; UUO's on the PDP-10.  Presumably these UUO's are
   accessible to all user programs when executing for users whose status
   bits allow network access.

   In addition to user program access, a convenient means for direct
   network access from the terminal is desirable.  A sub-system called
   "Telnet" is proposed which is a shell program around the network
   system primitives, allowing a teletype or similar terminal at a
   remote host to function as a teletype at the serving host.

System Primitives

   G. Deloche of U.C.L.A. has documented a proposed set of basic network
   primitives for inclusion in the operating systems of the respective
   HOSTs (NWG Note:  11).  The primitives are:

      Open primary connection

      Open auxiliary connection

      Transmit over connection

      Close connection.

   The details  and terminology are defined by Deloche and others in
   previous memos.  The primitives are system calls, available to
   programmers, and are most likely a part of the resident monitor,
   rather than the swappable executive.

Basic Terminal Access

   In addition to user programming access, it is desirable to have a
   subsystem program at each HOST which makes the network immediately
   accessible from the teletype without special programming.  Subsystems
   are commonly used system components such as text editors, compilers
   and interpreters.  The first network-related subsystem should allow

```
Similarly the command to get all the pages would be:

```python main.py 15```
