       IPv6 Multicast VPN (MVPN) Support Using PIM Control Plane
      and Selective Provider Multicast Service Interface (S-PMSI)
                             Join Messages

Abstract

   The specification for Multicast Virtual Private Networks (MVPNs)
   contains an option that allows the use of PIM as the control protocol
   between provider edge routers.  It also contains an option that
   allows UDP-based messages, known as Selective Provider Multicast
   Service Interface (S-PMSI) Join messages, to be used to bind
   particular customer multicast flows to particular tunnels through a
   service provider's network.  This document extends the MVPN
   specification (RFC 6513) so that these options can be used when the
   customer multicast flows are IPv6 flows.
